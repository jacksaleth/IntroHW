## Overview and Origin 

*Square Inc.

*Incorporated in 2009

*Founded by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey

* Square was started by Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, and his friend Jim McKelvey.  It was originally started after Jack realized that Jim was unable to complete a sale of glass faucets and fittings since he was only able to accept cash.  Jack was thus interested in the impacts of improved payment systems/processes and the value it could unlock for people and businesses on a micro level.  In 2013, the Cash App was created after a Square hackathon and resulted in a digital mobile wallet product which iterated and improved on products such like Venmo and PayPal.

*In October 2015, Square Inc. became a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.   Its initial market capitalization was around $5 billion and has grown exponentially since that time to $120 billion. 

## Business Activities:

* Square itself has tackled a number of issues in the fintech and financial space at large.  With respect to Cash App in particular, this branch of Square’s company is making peer-to-peer payments more efficient while also bringing access to an array of financial products to its users which were not readily available to them before.  For instance, tens of millions of people in the United States now have access to purchasing securities and even bitcoin through Cash App.  The simple user interface has made these products much more accessible to many individuals from underprivileged backgrounds.

The Cash App’s initial geographic concentration sprang from the South and often low-income and/or underbanked individuals in this region.  It has only been over the last few years when Cash App has penetrated larger markets such as Los Angeles and New York, which were earlier adopters of Venmo and Zelle instead.  

Jack Dorsey’s explanation of Cash App’s initial demographics (which have been rapidly expanding over the last few years) is that “People are using [the Cash App] as their primary banking account, and in some cases it’s their only bank account.”  

Cash App’s market at large extends to any and all individuals who can use a digital wallet.  At some point in the future, this should be close to entirety of the population.  While digital wallets have yet to reach this type of adoption in the United States, there are already 900 million people in China using digital wallets and adoption in the United States continues to grow at a rapid pace.  According to ARK Invest’s “whitepaper” on the Cash App, 65% of individuals between the ages of 25 and 34 in America own a digital wallet.  This number will only continue to grow in America and the rest of the developed nations, and specifically with those under the age of 30. 


*Cash App has done a great job of viral marketing in order to gain more customers.  In addition, they bring an array of services to consumers without requiring extensive paperwork or in-person interactions at a bank.  The concept of a digital wallet where anybody with a smartphone may make peer-to-peer payments and buy and sell securities and/or cryptocurrencies is still a relatively new concept and Cash App has been the first business to successfully integrate these various offerings into a simple app and interface. 

They are using blockchain and custody in order to store assets for crypto.  

## Landscape:

* Payments/Billing; Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking; Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies and Capital Investing

* One of the major trends has been the advent of commission free-trading which has given much greater access to the public when it comes to investing in securities.  Cryptocurrency payments have greatly evolved over the last 5 years, along with improved infrastructure and integration with the traditional financial when it comes to peer-to-peer payments. 

* PayPal, Coinbase


## Results

* Cash App has grown exponentially over the last few years. 

According to Bank of America’s Small Business Payments Spotlight 2019, digital wallet payments grew 41% at a compound annual rate between 2017 and 2019, while those on credit cards increased 13% and those on debit cards, in cash, and by checks declined. Unsurprisingly, digital wallets are enjoying strong adoption among both consumers and merchants, taking share from other payments methods. According to Bank of America’s Small Business Payments Spotlight 2019, digital wallet payments grew 41% at a compound annual rate between 2017 and 2019, while those on credit cards increased 13% and those on debit cards, in cash, and by checks declined.30 Indeed, as measured by active digital users, Venmo and Cash App have become the two largest financial institutions in the US, according to our research and as shown below. Most significant in differentiating between the success of digital wallets and traditional banks are customer acquisition costs (CACs). As illustrated in previous research, to acquire a new customer banks spend up to $1,500, more than seventy times the $20 that digital wallets spend, primarily because they lack organic peer-to-peer payment network effects.31 Customer acquisition costs have a significant impact on the lifetime value of a customer. Importantly, low CACs enable digital wallets to bank the unbanked who typically are unprofitable for and unattractive to traditional banks.  Among all consumer finance mobile apps, as of 2019, Cash App was #2 in terms of active users, only slightly behind Venmo but ahead of financial behemoths such as JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. 

* Cash App and Square have continued their torrid revenue and in Q1 of 2021, Square reported total net revenue of 4.04 billion and gross profit of $495 million.  




## Recommendations

* I would suggest that they offer Ethereum to their customers to purchase and also to create an Ethereum wallet which can be integrated into the Cash App.  This would only provide further access to underprivileged individuals to the benefits of decentralized finance. 

* Cash App’s users are largely young and tech literate.  As such, they would likely be the type of users that will be able to appreciate and get the most out of decentralized finance or “defi” products.  

* The main technologies would be those of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

* Financial inclusion, transparency and efficiency have always been the core applications and objectives of blockchain and cryptocurrency.  These core goals and values lineup perfectly with those of Square/Cash App and I believe that Cash App is perfectly situated to build on the innovations it has made within the current financial system by branching further into the realms of blockchain, cryptocurrency and decentralized finance.
